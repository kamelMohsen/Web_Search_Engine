    { title: "Berkelium - Wikipedia" ,statement: "The fact that berkelium readily assumes oxidation state +4 in solids, and is relatively stable in this state in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides. These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various inorganic oxidation agents can be applied to the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as bromates (BrO? 3), bismuthates (BiO? 3), chromates (CrO2? 4 and Cr 2O2? 7), silver(I) thiolate (Ag 2S 2O 8), lead(IV) oxide (PbO 2), ozone (O 3), or photochemical oxidation procedures. More recently, it has been discovered that some organic and bio-inspired molecules, such as the chelator called 3,4,3-LI(1,2-HOPO), can also oxidize Bk(III) and stabilize Bk(IV) under mild conditions.[19] Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with ion exchange, extraction chromatography or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid), amines, tributyl phosphate or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide cerium (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains).[46]" ,url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkelium"},

    { title: "Simi Valley, California - Wikipedia" ,statement: "Simi Valley and the surrounding hills have been the site of several television shows, including the long-running series Gunsmoke and M*A*S*H. Established in 1937 and opened to the public in 1949, the Corriganville Movie Ranch, established by Ray  Crash  Corrigan, is located at the extreme Eastern end of Simi Valley and was the production site for many movies and television shows. Today the site is open to the public as Corriganville Park, just off the Santa Susana Pass Road. The popular 1970s television show Little House on the Prairie utilized an expansive collection of sets constructed throughout the hilly landscapes of Big Sky Ranch in the Tapo Canyon hills north of Simi Valley and Santa Clarita, California. In addition to the Little House itself, the entire set for the town of Walnut Grove was built atop the hills. After finishing his work on the series, Michael Landon blew up the town (which became part of the final movie) but the Little House itself was left intact. In July 2004, the house was destroyed by a devastating California wildfire.[130] The 1973 film, The Doberman Gang was filmed entirely in Simi Valley, with the actual Bank of A. Levy as the backdrop for the robbery scenes. In 1983, Colleen McCullough's TV mini-series, The Thorn Birds, was brought to life in a remote corner of the Simi Valley. Australia presented too many hurdles for producers, the least of which was the restriction that only two American actors star in any movie filmed there; the rest had to be Australian. Location scouts went scouring, and Simi Valley, some of which strongly resembles parts of the Australian countryside, was chosen for the famous Cleary ranch and sheep station, Drogheda.[citation needed] In the 1984 film  Bachelor Party  starring Tom Hanks, the MANN 6 Movie Theater, formerly located within the Sycamore Shopping Center, was used for the movie theater scene. The 1986 western comedy film Three Amigos was partially filmed here. The Brandeis-Bardin Institute's House of the Book is the location of the original Power Ranger Power Chamber. The 1982 hit horror film Poltergeist was filmed on Roxbury Street in Simi Valley. At the time, the homes were new and the land behind the street was free, allowing plenty of access for studio trucks. 4267 Roxbury Street (the Freeling house in the film) suffered substantial earthquake damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. For the 1992 movie  Sneakers  with Robert Redford, the Gibraltar Savings building (later Countrywide at 400 Countrywide Way) was transformed to The Playtronics Toy company. The entire front lobby and hallways were redone for the movie and then returned to their original design. Some of the filming was done from hills across from the building. Many scenes were shot at night with the permission of the residents, due to the lighting required. The delivery of the ransom money in The Big Lebowski shows a highway sign naming Simi Valley. The video for Bullet with Butterfly Wings by The Smashing Pumpkins was filmed in Simi Valley. In the 1995 film Species, the character, Dr. Laura Baker, is said to be from Simi Valley. In the 2001 comedy Joe Dirt, the character found his long-lost parents in a trailer home park in Simi Valley (On another version of the movie, it was changed to Yucca Valley, California).[citation needed] The 1992 children's comedy Honey, I Blew Up the Kid was filmed in and around 676 Coldbrook Pl. In the 1992 film Forever Young starring Mel Gibson the test airstrip scenes and the highway chase scene were filmed on the west end of Simi Valley bordering Moorpark. Most of the 2003 film adaptation of The Cat in the Hat starring Mike Myers and Dakota Fanning was filmed in Simi Valley. The elaborate faux suburb where most of the film takes place was built on vacant land in a hilly area in West Simi Valley. Parts of Viva Rock Vegas, the sequel to the original Flintstones movie, was filmed at Rocky Peak. The video for  Hexagram,  by The Deftones was filmed with fans watching the band play the song in an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley. The 2003 video game Black & Bruised, has a character, Jumping Janet, whose hometown is Simi Valley. The skatepark in the 2005 movie Bad News Bears is in Simi Valley. In 2005, the PBS children's television series, Postcards from Buster, featured skateboard culture; interviewing local children and visiting the indoor skateboard park, Skatelab. The  Retail Rodeo  scenes from the Jennifer Aniston movie The Good Girl were filmed in the Ralph's shopping center on L.A. Ave. The set was constructed inside a vacant retail space. Nu-metal band Limp Bizkit filmed the music video for the single  Break Stuff  at Skatelab, a skate park in Simi Valley. The 2006 comedy The Benchwarmers was filmed on location in Knolls park and Santa Susana park, both located in Simi Valley. In March 2008, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra started filming in the northern hills above Simi Valley, near the Little House on the Prairie site. The Patrick Swayze movie  Three Wishes  used a baseball field in Simi Valley, near the Santa Susana Pass. In 2009, the rock band AFI filmed their music video for Beautiful Thieves, the second single from their album Crash Love, in a mansion in Simi Valley. The 2009 Hallmark Channel movie  Always and Forever  was filmed in various locations throughout Simi Valley and Moorpark, California. In 2009 Gavin Rossdale filmed part of his music video  Forever May You Run  in an office building on 555 E. Easy Street in Simi Valley. The fictional  Atmospheric Research Institute  from the 2009 NBC TV miniseries, The Storm, was filmed in an office building on 555 E.

In 2013, Bunim/Murray Productions used one of the two Simi Valley mansions to film a spin-off for The Bad Girls Club. Scenes in Criminal Minds were filmed in various places in Simi Valley, Including an intersection on Cochran St. Southern California radio station, KROQ, began hosting a  Punk Rock Prom  contest in early 2000 – two of which Simi Valley high schools won back to back. In 2000, Santa Susana High School won with Blink 182 performing at the school. In 2001, co-winners Santa Susana High School and Simi Valley High School won the contest, which was held at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Santa Clarita, CA, with Weezer and The Offspring headlining the event. In an October 2018 episode of podcast Comedy Bang Bang, Thomas Middleditch plays character Brody Broderson, who hails from the city.

Democracy attaches itself to a form of government: liberalism, to liberty and guarantees of liberty. The two may agree; they are not contradictory, but they are neither identical, nor necessarily connected. In the moral order, liberalism is the liberty to think, recognised and practiced. This is primordial liberalism, as the liberty to think is itself the first and noblest of liberties. Man would not be free in any degree or in any sphere of action, if he were not a thinking being endowed with consciousness. The freedom of worship, the freedom of education, and the freedom of the press are derived the most directly from the freedom to think. ^ Adams, Sean; Morioka, Noreen; Stone, Terry Lee (2006).

Bureaucratic overreach and environmental catastrophe are precisely the kinds of slow-moving existential challenges that democracies deal with very badly.... Finally, there is the threat du jour: corporations and the technologies they promote.  (pp. 56–57.) Vinje, Victor Condorcet (2014).
